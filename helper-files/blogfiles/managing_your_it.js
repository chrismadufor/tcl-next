Let’s face the fact; designing and implementing Information Technology (IT) Security Controls is not a priority for most organizations. This is especially true for Startups, and Small to Medium Enterprise, who focus their energy on getting their ideas to market and on growth. Thus, having IT security policies and procedures is not always the priority for most organizations unless forced by regulation or surreptitious hacking attempts.<br /><br />
However, with us Techspecialist Consulting Limited you can have the right partner to help you manage your IT systems and develop IT security policies and procedures for your organization at a cost effective way.<br /><br />
One thing you will also get for free is staff training and awareness. People always forget! Awareness and training for us is an on-going effort and delivered with whatever innovation necessary to ensure that the message gets across and sticks!<br /><br />
We work closely with each client to develop and realize the goals of their organization’s IT infrastructure, serving to maximize uptime and increase your bottom line. This starts with a free, “top to bottom” consultation and assessment of your systems, network, and security needs.<br /><br />
