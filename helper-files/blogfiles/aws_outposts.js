Cloud Computing! You must have heard of this trending topic for businesses in the past years. But what is this buzz about? How does that affect your business or organization? <br /> <br />
Cloud computing is a term that describes how businesses can use information technology resources, such as servers, storage, and networks, over a network rather than building or buying them. Cloud computing allows businesses to access these resources on-demand while still being able to choose how much they want to spend on them. Simply put, it is “Pay as you go”. <br /> <br />
It offers seamless upgrade or downgrade of IT resources as your business needs or demands increase or decrease with only a click of a button! It is no wonder that businesses all over the world are using cloud services to save time and money in their day-to-day operations. <br /> <br />
Rather than build, host and manage their own servers, data centers, and networking infrastructure; businesses rely on providers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure for this infrastructure. These providers take care of it all – from designing the network infrastructure all the way down to ensure that it’s always up and running – for a low monthly fee. <br /> <br />
With the increasing demand for cloud hosting in Nigeria, more and more companies are looking to hire a cloud hosting provider. Cloud hosting providers have proven to  provide reliable, secure, and affordable resources for their customers. <br />
This must have informed the newly launched  Amazon Web Services Outposts called the <a class="font-semibold text-blue-500" href='https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/' target='_blank'>‘AWS Outposts’</a>, an infrastructure service that enables users to locally host, run, manage their workload and connect with Amazon’s cloud service offerings in Nigeria. <br /><br />
In a statement released last week in the Businessday, Amazon described the infrastructure as fully managed and configurable computing and storage racks built with AWS-designed hardware. These allows customers the liberty to run AWS services on-premises, including computing, storage, and databases, while seamlessly connecting to AWS’s broad array of services in the cloud. <br /><br />
This implies that businesses in Nigeria who have workloads that require low latency, data processing, or data storage on premises can benefit from AWS Outposts. Thus, business organizations and government ministries, departments and agencies who are desirous in reducing running costs, improve service delivery and generally improve general services can tap into the new cloud computing services launched by the Amazon. <br /><br />
We are convinced that the commencement of this great service will further strengthen the democratization of cloud services in Nigeria. A space which hitherto has been dominated by an elite few cloud services such as MainOne Cloud, Rack Centre, Web4Africa, Truehost Cloud Hosting and few others. <br /><br />
