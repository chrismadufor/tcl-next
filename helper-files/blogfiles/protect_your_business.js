Recently, my team and I have been doing some works on people-centric protection for IT systems. This has become more necessary now than ever before with the spate of cyber attacks on small and big organizations across the world, we can not but ensure we do the best within our capacity to protect our clients and staff from falling victim.<br /><br />
With more employees using different (personal) devices and more data moving to the cloud, there are more threats and security risks to think about. Data can easily get leaked outside your organization, devices that connect to sensitive business information can be lost or stolen, and people can make mistakes. Cybercriminals have become extremely creative in inventing mechanisms to bypass any security settings.<br /><br />
Gone are the days when a lot of money, time, and resources are devoted to the technical side of security, such as firewalls, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing. The truth is no matter how secured your Security Architecture is, an attacker could still bypass years of IT security work through a social engineer attack?<br /><br /> 
Social engineering is one of the modern ways unscrupulous people steal data, especially if employees are unaware of the ways to prevent them and how to recognize and combat them.<br /><br />The truth is you can never be too careful with the security and compliance of your IT services. At Techspecialist Consulting Limited, we prepare your team to fight social attacks.<br /><br />
